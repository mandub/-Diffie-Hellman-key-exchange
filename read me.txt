My project is an implementation of key exchange using Diffie Hellman algorithm.
it contain two file one called Alice and the other called Bob .
To run the project correctly you need to run alice file first then run Bob file.
I choose "localhost" but you can run it in any ip but you need to change the port.
thanks
